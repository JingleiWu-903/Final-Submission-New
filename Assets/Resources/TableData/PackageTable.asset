    name: Garbage
    description: After metal garbage such as aluminum cans sinks to the seabed, it
      may be washed into the coral structure under the action of waves and currents,
      scratching or crushing the coral skeleton and destroying the growth surface.
      The metal and can paint and sealant slowly corrode, releasing metal ions and
      harmful chemicals, causing chronic toxicity to corals and symbiotic algae.
      It may also cover the surface of the coral, impeding water flow, light and
      nutrient exchange.

    name: Can
    description: If oil barrels are damaged or residual oil leaks, petroleum and
      chemical residues will enter the seawater and form a covering layer, blocking
      corals from obtaining sunlight and oxygen, and destroying the normal metabolism
      of symbiotic algae and corals. At the same time, it pollutes water quality,
      reduces water transparency, inhibits coral growth and even causes death.

    name: Iron
    description: After steel or other heavy metal items sink to the seabed, as the
      seawater corrodes, metal ions such as iron, zinc, and lead will be released,
      changing the local water chemical environment, becoming toxic to corals and
      symbiotic microorganisms, and interfering with mineralization and physiological
      functions. Large pieces of metal may also physically cover the coral or bottom
      surface, blocking light and water flow, hindering coral growth and seafloor
      ecological exchange.

    name: Net
    description: Abandoned fishing nets that float or sink to the bottom can easily
      become entangled in coral branches, coral heads or substrate structures. Entanglement
      can compress corals, causing bone fractures and tissue necrosis. Long-term
      presence also blocks water flow, blocks light, hinders the colonization and
      growth of coral larvae, and traps fish and invertebrates, causing chain ecological
      damage.

    name: Finger Coral
    description: Finger corals grow in thick, upright branches resembling short fingers.
      Their sturdy shape helps them survive strong currents in shallow reefs. They
      offer shelter for small fish and invertebrates and play an important role in
      strengthening reef structure and supporting local biodiversity.

    name: Foliose Coral
    description: Foliose corals form broad, leaf-like plates that maximize sunlight
      for photosynthesis. Common in bright shallow waters, their layered structure
      creates hiding spaces for small marine life. Though fragile in strong waves,
      they greatly enhance the complexity and habitat diversity of coral reefs.
